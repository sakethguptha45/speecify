/**
 * A Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with Time-to-Live (TTL) support. Items are kept in the cache until they either
 * reach their TTL or the cache reaches its size and/or item limit. When the limit is exceeded, the cache evicts the
 * item that was least recently accessed (based on the timestamp of access). Items are also automatically evicted if they
 * are expired, as determined by the TTL.
 * An item is considered accessed, and its last accessed timestamp is updated, whenever `has`, `get`, or `set` is called with its key.
 *
 * Implement the LRU cache provider here and use the lru-cache.test.ts to check your implementation.
 * You're encouraged to add additional functions that make working with the cache easier for consumers.
